{"transcription": "IT’S BEET WEEK,
And everyone’s excited!
The trains are napping
in the yard, but
they, too, are delighted.

The village buzzes with glee –
no hexes to be found –
so offer up your queries
and cycle on down

to the town square
where a woman now sits lonely
awaiting sunset silverwares
when she won’t be the only
hungry fellow there.

Oh, no – we will pound on all the tables
and dent their matte veneers
thin of belly, thick of heart,
deafening powerful ears –
Alpha beta goodness gracious!
We must demand our hams!
And make it plain
that on each day
we’ll cage up our captors
and slurp our fancy jams.
