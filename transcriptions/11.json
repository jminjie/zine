{"transcription": "IT’S BEET WEEK,\n And everyone’s excited!\n The trains are napping\n in the yard, but\n they, too, are delighted.\n \n The village buzzes with glee –\n no hexes to be found –\n so offer up your queries\n and cycle on down\n \n to the town square\n where a woman now sits lonely\n awaiting sunset silverwares\n when she won’t be the only\n hungry fellow there.\n \n Oh, no – we will pound on all the tables\n and dent their matte veneers\n thin of belly, thick of heart,\n deafening powerful ears –\n Alpha beta goodness gracious!\n We must demand our hams!\n And make it plain\n that on each day\n we’ll cage up our captors\n and slurp our fancy jams.
