{"transcription": "Meet teen me

She had no queer quarries, but a poet
might quip that from the pit comes the shale.
That is to say, she rode the line
as time she’d waste
emerging from the broken rock
to pave the roads which she would walk.

Waxier than most, she’d swipe a beer
to get a grip; exist inside this
blotter and saw down the redwood coast /

The shape of a body
with exam gloves on
may jiggle and shake,
quiver and quake,
but still will hold form.

The flame may waver,
renege on wager,
may raze the wood barren
and grow quiet,
but still will hold form
as firm as a leek or a boot
to the teeth
and, like bagging pears,
not without a dent.
