{"transcription": "Meet teen me\n \n She had no queer quarries, but a poet\n might quip that from the pit comes the shale.\n That is to say, she rode the line\n as time she’d waste\n emerging from the broken rock\n to pave the roads which she would walk.\n \n Waxier than most, she’d swipe a beer\n to get a grip; exist inside this\n blotter and saw down the redwood coast /\n \n Dent\n \n The shape of a body\n with exam gloves on\n may jiggle and shake,\n quiver and quake,\n but still will hold form.\n \n The flame may waver,\n renege on wager,\n may raze the wood barren\n and grow quiet,\n but still will hold form\n as firm as a leek or a boot\n to the teeth\n and, like bagging pears,\n not without a dent.
