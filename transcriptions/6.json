{"transcription": "Our Town

He said he wanted out
That we were spooked and sank and he wanted out
Out past where the blocks turn arrays
Out through the moist knot of cloth
Out of this four clip
                  fork-nixed
                    binned blunt
   shit tier town
He’d be out
And we’d be short one dapper vagabond.
