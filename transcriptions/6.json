{"transcription": "Our Town\n \n He said he wanted out\n That we were spooked and sank and he wanted out\n Out past where the blocks turn arrays\n Out through the moist knot of cloth\n Out of this four clip\n fork-nixed\n binned blunt\n shit tier town\n He’d be out\n And we’d be short one dapper vagabond.
