{"transcription": "Bananagrams is a simple board game which uses only a set of letter tiles. The general goal is to use all of your own tiles to make real words from left to right and up to down in a connected scrabble-like array. To play our rules with 2–5 people you need:\n \n A pack of Bananagrams tiles (or you can make your own)\n A spacious playing space like the top of a large table\n Some pens and paper\n \n Shuffle all the tiles around face down in a pile. Every player then gets 40 tiles of their own. When the game starts, each player flips over their tiles and tries to use them to make connected words at least 4 letters long.\n \n At any point a player can say PEEL and grab a tile from the middle, and all other players still in the game must also grab a tile.\n \n At any point a player can say DUMP and put a tile back into the middle, replacing it with 3 other tiles.\n \n The first person to use up all of their tiles is the “winner,” and the game ends when all players have used their tiles.\n \n Lastly, (this is the fun part), you take 5 minutes for every player to write a poem using all of their words.\n \n This zine is a compilation of such poems."}
