{"transcription": "During this year's quarentine, our 3-bedroom. 5-person apartment has found plenty of time to dive into the board games we own. Today, Mark was at Jo's and Sijia and Chad were out biking, so Michela and I spent the morning in with iced coffee and a french omelette on toast, which I have recently begun to perfect. Around 11, we broke out Bananagrams."}
