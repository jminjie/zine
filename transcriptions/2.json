{"transcription": "To be sated and sane,\n in a time such as this,\n To be oared through the channel,\n is a chore for the rower.\n Such a chore that,\n in the ‘twixts and the ‘tweens,\n we find ourselves broiled\n in joyous coitus\n and fined ourselves sums\n for the teat we sucked\n and judged ourselves sinful\n to be near the hoot.\n "}
