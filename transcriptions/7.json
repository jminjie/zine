{"transcription": "‘Frank tries fish’ or ‘Remembrance’

It never was my forte, dear, but brave as I can be
I’ll take the fish with roti, dear, with rage I will not seethe.
And as I cut the fish in two, the sauce I will allot
Harkens to exciting roomies’ sauces I forgot.

This poem is about religion! Ooh –

verse from a zealot mouth
like blush upon a snout
a billion naval ships
amassed in tow like spawn of fish
or flowers an azalea
with no word with no desire
but to burn a bush on fire
and the choir of clover
sings until its over
