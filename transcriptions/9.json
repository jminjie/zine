{"transcription": "“What proud pram,” the traveler announced,
“would hold such a moldy fruit?
T’would give a crew scurvy
whilst they drag through the sea”
he sang with a strum of his lute.

“The baby, it had thick cheveux noir”
At this, the French sailors did nod,
“But fate would reveal
the swaddle contained
a swarming cabin mice squad!”

The crowd gasped loudly - the trade had been botched
the feud is true, the king’s gift a fraud
“What ye think is warm,
would ye then scald
and leave ye feeling watched.”
